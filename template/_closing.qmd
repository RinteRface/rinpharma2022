## Test with your own app

Get a top notch app? Try to setup `{shinyValidator}` and run it.

## Be patient

CI/CD and testing are not easy!

```{r}
dracula_card(
  borderColor = "red",
  outline = TRUE,
  dracula_text(
    color = "red",
    weight = "bold",
    size = "lg",
    "Pro tip: always run the code locally first with `audit_app` until no error."
  )
)
```
